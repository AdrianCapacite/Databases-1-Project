# Databases 1 Project

This is a database project for the Database 1 module at TU Dublin. It involves
designing and implementing a Burger Shack database that includes entities like
staff, tables, customers, and bookings.  Addressed various issues such as staff
types, table attributes duplication, and naming conflicts with SQL keywords.
Non-key constraints have been implemented to ensure data integrity. An ERD represents
the logical model, while a physical model is provided for implementation in a specific DBMS.
